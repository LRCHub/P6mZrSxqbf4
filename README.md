> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Don't be afraid of the mirror
I'll catch you, when you fall
The writing is in the wall
I'll catch you, when you fall
Don't be afraid of the mirror
I'll catch you, when you fall
The writing is in the wall
I'll catch you, when you fall
Don't be afraid of the mirror
I'll catch you, when you fall
The writing is in the wall
I'll catch you, when you fall
We're living in the future
We're living in the future
I can't believe
I can't believe
I can't believe
We're living in the future
Don't be afraid of the mirror
I'll catch you, when you fall
The writing is in the wall
I'll catch you, when you fall
Don't be afraid of the mirror
I'll catch you, when you fall
The writing is in the wall
I'll catch you, when you fall
