Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder of dolls
Or of goblins or shoes?" (Raoul)
"Or of riddles or frocks?"
Those picnics in the attic
"Or of chocolates?"

Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
No, "What I love best," Lotte said
"Is when I'm asleep in my bed"

And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head

Oh, you sang like an angel tonight

Father said, "When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you"
My father is dead, Raoul
And I have been visited by the Angel of Music (oh, no doubt of it)
And now, we'll go to supper

No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict
Well, I shan't keep you up late (Raoul, no)
You must change, I'll order my carriage
Two minutes, little Lotte (no, Raoul, wait!)

Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph!

Angel, I hear you, speak, I listen
Stay by my side, guide me
Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me
Enter at last, master

Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!

Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel

I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music

(Whose is that voice?)
(Who is that in there?)

I am your Angel of Music (Christine, Christine!)
Come to me, Angel of Music
