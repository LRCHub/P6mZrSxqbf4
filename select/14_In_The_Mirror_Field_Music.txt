Think about me
That's all I'm asking for
Think about this
You know we need to allow for a turnaround
Oh, and all these games to solve
To recognise
In the mirror

I wish I could change and make new rules
Conduct myself better
I have no rights and I give none
I should hold myself better
We are hopeless and lost
We subjugate ourselves
We're close enough to stop

I'm looking for common sense
Worry 'bout the same old things
Enough to get close to them
Close enough
In the mirror

I'm looking for common sense
(I'm looking for common sense)
Worry 'bout the same old things
(Worry 'bout the same old things)
Enough to get close to them
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough
