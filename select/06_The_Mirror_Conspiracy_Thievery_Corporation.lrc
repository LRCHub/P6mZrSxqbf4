[00:31.15] What I did here
[00:33.23] Is in the past
[00:35.82] How could we see
[00:37.94] We'd never last
[00:45.44] 
[00:40.59] And time will tell
[00:43.04] And you're all eyes (?)
[00:45.88] And now the truth
[00:48.04] Is your demise
[00:55.04] 
[00:50.84] All my heart
[00:54.29] All of your tears
[01:00.29] Our whole world
[01:04.05] Is smoke and mirrors
[01:14.05] 
[01:10.24] All my heart
[01:14.01] All of your tears
[01:20.24] Our whole world
[01:24.06] Is smoke and mirrors
[01:34.06] 
[01:51.35] You're here yourself (?)
[01:53.35] In wandered eyes (?)
[01:55.70] But now I've seen
[01:58.06] Through your disguise
[02:00.70] From where I stand
[02:03.39] A lovely view
[02:05.86] Your world unwinds
[02:08.38] You come unglued
[02:16.38] 
[02:10.57] All my heart
[02:13.93] All of your tears
[02:20.22] Our whole world
[02:23.97] Is smoke and mirrors
[02:33.97] 
[02:30.26] All my heart
[02:33.94] All of your tears
[02:40.36] Our whole world
[02:44.01] Is smoke and mirrors
