[00:01.10] Shapes in the drink like Christ
[00:06.71] Cracks in the pale blue wall
[00:12.02] I'm walking slowly and quickly but always away
[00:18.14] I'm twisting twisting to the floor
[00:35.14] 
[00:24.69] Flowers in your mouth and the same dry song
[00:30.18] The routine from laughter land
[00:36.17] Sixteen white legs and a row of teeth
[00:41.85] I watch you in secrecy
[00:52.85] 
[00:47.90] You're dying for the hope is gone
[00:53.53] From here we go nowhere again
[00:58.54] Oh I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing too much
[01:04.26] I can't climb out the way I fell in, oh
[01:23.76] 
[01:11.49] Jump with me for that old forgotten dance
[01:17.18] The midnight sun will burn you up
[01:22.10] And your life is cold, your life is hard
[01:28.39] Your life is too much for words
[01:43.89] 
[01:58.96] These occasions are such a relief
[02:04.24] Another point, another view to send
[02:08.69] Hey hey hey, we start to talk and it's, and it's all so safe
[02:16.69] Oh I feed you in my dreams
[02:29.69] 
[02:21.83] Footsteps on a wire, high above my head
[02:27.50] The stain reveals my real intention
[02:32.36] I'm the waiting beast, I'm the twisted nerve
[02:40.09] As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed
[02:45.57] As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed, to the body in my bed
[03:19.07] 
[03:03.39] Look at the piggy, piggy in the mirror
[03:06.14] At the piggy, piggy in the mirror
[03:09.00] At the piggy, piggy in the mirror
[03:12.01] At the piggy, piggy in the mirror
[03:28.51] 
[03:16.29] Look at the piggy in the, at the piggy, piggy in the mirror
[03:20.91] Oh look at the piggy in the mirror
[03:23.72] Oh look at the piggy in the mirror
[03:26.80] Oh look at the piggy in the mirror, oh oh oh
